summary: "Asking someone's favorite is always great, except when you're selling stuff."

Asking someone's favorites is the best conversational trick I know. Everyone loves talking about their favorites, they'll blow out their cheeks, shift their stance and think for a bit, then answer very earnestly. It's amazing, that conversational value vanishes when asking service employees to recommend favorites. I used to think people were shy anytime recommendations would be consumed in front of them. Then I went somewhere without tipping, and no one felt sensitive about the question. Servers proudly handed me their favorite, just like a normal person does in a nice converation.

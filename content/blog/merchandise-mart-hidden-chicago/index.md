## History

The Merchandise Mart was the world's largest building (by area) when it opened in 1930. The first building with its own zip code was originaly designed to centralize all 13 Marshall Field and Company warehouses in Chicago. It opened 6 months into the Great Depression and immediately started losing millions of dollars every year. The wholesale industry in America was already losing ground to urban retailers empowered by easy rail transportation and Marshall Field quickly yeilded their warehouse space to retail locations, though the Mart's focus on home funishings still survives.

In 1943, the Pentagon stole the title of world's largest building as the Mart was occupied hosting wartime goverment administration. By 1945 the building was sold to Joseph P. Kennedy, the 35th president's father. He focused on public engagemnt: opening the building for public tours and creating a merchant's hall of fame by installing 8 busts along the Chicago River. During the 40s and 50s, the Mart was the largest host of trade shows in America and a major source of the Kennedy's wealth through the sale of the building in 1998.

The sucess of the Mart spurred the construction of the associated Chicago Apparel Center in 1977. In 1988, the buildings were physically connected by an elevated walkway over Orleans Street. In the early 90s, the first two floors were renovated with restaurants and shops to capture the growing residental population of the North Loop.

The Chicago Riverwalk now traces along the opposite bank of the Chicago River, and the Mart has taken advantage of the new vistas by installing a 2.5 acre projector to covers the South face of the building. Every night the projectors display a

### Architecture

The lowest floors of the Merchadise Mart are an architectural delight. The exterior corners of the building are sliced off (chamfered), gently reducing the weight of the building and mirroring the slant of Orleans Street. The soaring ceilings are split by an elevator bank with stunning Art Deco designs. The South Lobby has two stories of stadium seating for enjoying lunch while examining the 17 murals celebrating commerce. 

### Hidden In Plain Sight
The building delights me becuase it is public in a way that has largely vanished from modern life. There are public bathrooms, you can freely walk up and down staircases, and there are very few off limit areas. I've explored it exntesively, and here are my favorite moments.

#### What A Bargin
After the first two floors the building is quiet and drab: short ceilings, inoffensive patterened carpet, and endless white walls designed to be replaced at will. On occasion, these floors erupt with trade show activity. NeoCon is the largest, transforming the wide hallways into jostling scrums. After the show receeds, the retailers start a new season, dragging their slightly out of fashion furnature into the hallway, where it's priced with taped on scraps of paper. These hallways are the best place in Chicago to get a once in a lifetime bargin on barely used office furnature.

#### Tassles For Everyone
There are dozens of delightful stores hidden in the bowels of the Mart. The Kholer store used to have a device for measuring the electrical capacitance of the human body. I could touch a sink and see a graph of all the Picofarrads I carry with me. That's been uninstalled, but fortunately the tassle store still stands strong.

Samuel & Sons makes the 6th floor a joy to visit. There are wall to wall tassles, some the size of basketballs. The building's quiet hum crates a reverental mood enforced by fine furnature stores flanking every step. Inside the tassle store

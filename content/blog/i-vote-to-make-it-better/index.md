Thanks to the [Chicago Open Data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), anyone can see every [crime reported in the city](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data) and filter by location. Crime on the CTA has generally decreases from 2001, but 3,651 crimes in 2022 is too many and there were about 25% more crimes increased about 25% over 2021. 

The [daily ridership](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97/data) of the CTA doesn't have November and December numbers yet, but for the first 10 months of 2022 there were 3,409 crimes over 203,743,293 rides.

It's extremely unpopular and doesn't make people like you to say "everyone needs to be responsible for the safety of those around them."

I was talking to a person who had come to America from somewhere with lots of violence. I asked what they liked about this country, and they said "no one gets hung from the light poles here". That shocked me enough to jolt my gratitude free. 

Years later, I was well-fed in a warm room talking about who should be mayor of Chicago. Someone brought up safety on the CTA (Chicago's public transit system). People don't feel safe on public transportation and there are plenty of media platforms helping people say so.

## Data and Its Discontents
Thanks to the [Chicago Open Data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), anyone can see every [crime reported in the city](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data) and filter by location. Crime on the CTA has generally decreased since 2001, but 3,651 crimes in 2022 is too many and there were about 25% more crimes in 2022 than 2021. 

The [daily ridership](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97/data) of the CTA doesn't have November and December numbers yet, but for the first 10 months of 2022 there were 3,409 crimes over 203,743,293 rides. That's one crime for every 59,766 CTA trips.

Statistical arguments about safety aren't emotionally convincing. Being safer compared to some point in the past is not the same as feeling safe, and we're allowed to demand better.

## Public and Private
Why do people rarely feel unsafe in their cars but very frequently feel unsafe on public transporation? The answer is in the name: being in public makes people nervous. People know they can rely on themselves, even when they're wrong. People know they can't rely on strangers, even when they're wrong. 

That's a part of what makes voting feel so powerful. It's a private choice transmuted into public consensus. If the right candidate is elected I feel the balm of the world agreeing with my personal vision. If the wrong person is elected, I can sink a little deeper into knowing that strangers don't have my back.

## The Solution: More Danger
There is a much more direct and effective way to make the CTA feel safe. In an unsafe situation, I can raise my hand and say "this is not acceptable". Plenty of people think it's stupid, who would accept [more personal risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html) to reduce risk for a stranger? I promise I'll try.

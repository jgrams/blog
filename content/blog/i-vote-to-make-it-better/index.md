I was at a party, talking about who should be Chicago's next mayor. The issue was safety on public transportation. In any public space people should be able to feel safe. 

Thanks to the [Chicago Open Data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), I can look all the [crimes reported in the city](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data) and filter by location. Crime on the CTA is clearly decreasing, but 236,000 crimes in 2022 is still a lot. The [daily ridership](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97/data) of the CTA for 2022 isn't yet fully available, but in 2019  one crime happened every 1,743 CTA rides.

Being statistically safer compared to some point in the past is not the same as feeling safe, and we can demand better. The problem is the effectiveness of public safety policies must be measured in statistical terms. As humans, there is a fundamental disconnect between our perception of the world and the world.

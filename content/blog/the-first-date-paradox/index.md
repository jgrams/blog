It's easy to pick out people who are on a first date. A palpable excitement blended with nervousness hovers over the event. The participants are attentive and curious. It's both obvious and insane that as a relationship grows more familiar and vital, that feeling vanishes. At some point, people start checking their phones, and start assuming they can guess what their partner will say next.

It's nice to relax around someone, but it feels like a reflection of something that a lot of people get wrong. My whole life, I've been very concerned about the opinion of strangers. I don't want to disappoint people, I want everyone to have a good time. I generally understand the emotional tides of the people I care about the most, and can trust that if I dissapoint them, the worm will turn and I'll be able to please them later. With strangers, I think I only have one opportunity to make a good impression, and want to be sure that.

There is value in feeling comfortable and easy with someone. There is value in knowing that they have my back, even if I don't live up to their expectations. I value loyalty highly, and I'm a very loyal person. There are friends who didn't tell me my drinking was a problem, and there are acquintances who did. There is almost an antagonism, if someone who loves me is sad or grumpy, I want to follow them around like a sad puppy, making sure they aren't mad at me. That's not okay, asking for the soothing of others while they are in need of soothing is a form of manipulation.

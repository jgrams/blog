summary: "Asking someone's favorite is great conversation, except when they're selling stuff."

Asking someone's favorite is the greatest conversational trick of all time. They'll blow out their cheeks, shift around and think for a bit, then answer very earnestly. 

It's amazing that asking service employees for favorites can be nerve-wracking. I used to think people didn't like recommending a thing destined to be consumed before them. Then I went somewhere without tipping, and no one felt sensitive about the question. Servers proudly presented me their favorite, just like a normal person during a nice converation.
